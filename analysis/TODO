Want to find a way to focus on terms that occur in multiple tweets.

===

Plan:
	(1) JMW: Fit text model to data from traditional ideal points and text to produce a "text measure of bias". Use Senate to fit model and make predictions for House. (Seems better to go other direction?)
	(2) Drew: Fit text model to data from traditional ideal points and social network to produce a "SNA measure of bias". Use Senate to fit model and make predictions for House. (Vice versa?)
	(3) Compare results.

Try leaving more terms in the original DTM. Assess RMSE as function of columns.
